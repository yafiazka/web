Designed and developed a comprehensive Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system for hospitals that streamlines how doctors collect, manage, and access patient data. The system delivers:

- Improved clinical workflow efficiency
- Enhanced data accuracy 
- Secure, real-time access to medical information for providers and patients

Successfully integrated with key national services:
- Balai Sertifikasi Elektronik (BSrE) for digital signature certification
- Badan Penyelenggara Jaminan Sosial (BPJS) for seamless insurance claims and verification

These integrations ensure full regulatory compliance and operational efficiency.
